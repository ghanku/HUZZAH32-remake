# Open Hardware Template
This is a skeleton for open hardware projects, based on KiCad designs for the schematics and PCB, and some software. 

**New:** There is now a bash script rename.sh that simplifies this task.

Please do NOT make your own designs forks of this template on Github.

## PCB Production
The design rules are set up for OSH Park, but double-check they fit your needs before using them. 

Please do not forget to add the text "Licensed under CERN OHL v.1.2" to the silkscreen of the PCB and to the schematics.
